# This is an app for IoT devices 

Devices on various locations send their current air measurements to The Things Network. We developed a program that awaits HTTP  requests from The Things Network when there is new data. Program saves requests to the database, and displays them on the web page.  Our tech stack was ASP.Net Core and MongoDB.
